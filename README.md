Here I have successfully completed a Team Task with Ankit Kriti, Roshni Patil, and Sandesh Jain under the guidance of Vimal Daga sir. This task was related to the concepts that we learnt till now in the ARTH - The School of Technologies.

Task 8: Team Task
Create a Menu Using Python integrating all the concepts that have been taught by Vimal sir till now.

Task Description:
In this task, we implemented the concepts of Hadoop, LVM Partition, Docker, and AWS using Python 3 code. 
We built a menu-driven program in python that can be useful in automation for the above-mentioned technologies. This program is written in such a way that it can be understood even by the people who donâ€™t have prior knowledge about these technologies.
